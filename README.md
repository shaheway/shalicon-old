# Shalicon: An Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor

This README file is generated by both Google's Bard and OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Shalicon is a 64-bit out-of-order RISC-V processor supporting RV64IM, designed and implemented in Chisel language. It features a Gshare branch predictor and is open-source under the GPL-3.0 license. Shalicon is designed to be easy to understand and modify.

### Features

- Out-of-order execution

- RV64IM instruction set support

- Multiple functional units

- Gshare branch predictor

- Simple and easy-to-understand design

### Getting Started

To get started with Shalicon, you will need to have the following installed:

- A Java Development Kit (JDK)

- The Chisel compiler

- A Verilog simulator

Once you have these installed, you can download the Shalicon source code from GitHub.

To build Shalicon, you will need to use the Chisel compiler. Once you have compiled the source code, you can run the simulator to test your design.

#### Prerequisites

Before you can start using Shalicon, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) 2.12.14 or later

- [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) 1.5.5 or later

- [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator) 4.106 or later

#### Installation

To clone and build the Shalicon repository, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaheway/shalicon.git
cd shalicon
sbt compile
```

This will download all the required dependencies and compile the code.

#### Usage

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
sbt test
```

This will compile and run all the tests in the project.

To generate the Verilog code, use the following command:

```bash
sbt "runMain shalicon.ShaliconMain"
```

This will generate the Verilog code for the processor in the `target/verilog` directory.

### Documentation

The Shalicon documentation is available on the project website. The documentation includes a user guide, a reference manual, and a tutorial.

### Contributing

Shalicon is an open-source project and we welcome contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute, please read the contribution guidelines.

### License

Shalicon is released under the GNU General Public License, Version 3 (GPL-3.0).

### Additional Information

Shalicon is still under development, but it has already been used to run a number of benchmarks, including SPEC2006 and CoreMark. We are continuing to improve Shalicon and we hope that it will be a valuable resource for the RISC-V community.

**Thanks for using Shalicon!**
